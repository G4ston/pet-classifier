# pet-classifier
I made a model that classifies pets according to whether they are cats or dogs. It is a model that was trained with Google images and the application is uploaded to [huginfaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces/G4ston/Dog_Cat_Classifier). I developed it as a project for Jeremy Howard's DeepLearning for coders course, fast.ai.
